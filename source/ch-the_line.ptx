  <title>Analytic Geometry on the Real Line</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Students often encounter the term <term>analytic geometry</term> in the chapter of an algebra or precalculus course where the conic sections, particularly, ellipses and hyperbolas, are discussed. However, analytic geometry is a much larger topic. Like how fish, living in water, don't know they are wet, analytic geometry is how we do mathematics beyond basic arithmetic. Analytic geometry is, fundamentally, about thinking of geometric shapes as collections of points, each of which has numerical coordinates in the space in which we are working and which are collectively described by an equation in the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Then we use the techniques of algebra to solve geometric problems involving these collections of points using their equations. From the moment when we first start of thinking of points as having coordinates or thinking of equations like <m>y=mx+b</m> as lines, we are doing analytic geometry.</p>

    <p>The simplest space to be working in is when the world is just a single point. The next simplest is when all that exists is on a single line. The next simplest is when all that exists is in a single plane. The "size" of a space is measured by a counting number called the <term>dimension</term> which indicates how many fundamental "directions" are available in your space. On a line, you can only go back and forth (one fundamental direction with its backwards direction), but in a plane, you can go north and south or east and west (two fundamental directions) or a partial combination of two fundamental directions (northwest). "Space" is considered three-dimensional because we get the two fundamental directions of the plane, plus the up/down direction. Physicists and mathematicians also work in spaces of dimension higher than three for some problems.</p>

    <p>In this first chapter, we will consider all the universe to be a single line and see how the analytic geometry idea works in this simpler space.</p>
