        <li>Graph the following hyperbolas. Identify all six pieces of key information for each.
         <ol type="a">
           <li><p>\(\frac{x^2}{9}-\frac{y^2}{16}=1\)</p>
               <p>This equation has the standard form for a hyperbola. Since the positive term is the \(x\)-term, this is a hyperbola whose transverse axis is horizontal. We see that \(a=3\) and \(b=4,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>

           <li><p>\(\frac{x^2}{16}-\frac{y^2}{9}=1\)</p>
               <p>This equation has the standard form for a hyperbola. Since the positive term is the \(x\)-term, this is a hyperbola whose transverse axis is horizontal. We see that \(a=4\) and \(b=3,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{4^2+3^2}=5.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
               <p><img src="img/HW20240403_01b.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
           <li><p>\(\frac{y^2}{9}-\frac{x^2}{16}=1\)</p>
               <p>This equation has the standard form for a hyperbola. Since the positive term is the \(y\)-term, this is a hyperbola whose transverse axis is vertical. We see that \(a=3\) and \(b=4,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
            <p><img src="img/HW20240403_01c.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
           <li><p>\(\frac{y^2}{16}-\frac{x^2}{9}=1\)</p>
               <p>This equation has the standard form for a hyperbola. Since the positive term is the \(y\)-term, this is a hyperbola whose transverse axis is vertical. We see that \(a=4\) and \(b=3,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{4^2+3^2}=5.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
               <p><img src="img/HW20240403_01d.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
           <li><p>\(\frac{x^2}{5}-\frac{y^2}{7}=1\)</p>
               <p>This equation has the standard form for a hyperbola. Since the positive term is the \(x\)-term, this is a hyperbola whose transverse axis is horizontal. We see that \(a=\sqrt{5}\) and \(b=\sqrt{7},\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{(\sqrt{5})^2+(\sqrt{7})^2}=\sqrt{12}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
               <p><img src="img/HW20240403_01e.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
           <li><p>\(9x^2-16y^2-144=0\)</p>
               <p>This equation is not in standard form. We can put it in standard form as follows: \(9x^2-16y^2-144=0\Rightarrow 9x^2-16y^2=144\Rightarrow \frac{9x^2}{144}-\frac{16y^2}{144}=1\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{16}-\frac{y^2}{9}=1.\) This is the same equation as problem 1b. The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
               <p><img src="img/HW20240403_01b.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
           <li><p>\(25y^2-9x^2-225=0\)</p>
               <p>This equation is not in standard form. We can put it in standard form as follows: \(25y^2-9x^2-225=0\Rightarrow 25y^2-9x^2=225\Rightarrow \frac{25y^2}{225}-\frac{9x^2}{225}=1\Rightarrow \frac{y^2}{9}-\frac{x^2}{25}=1.\) Since the positive term is the \(y\)-term, this is a hyperbola whose transverse axis is vertical. We see that \(a=3\) and \(b=5,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{(3)^2+(5)^2}=\sqrt{34}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
               <p><img src="img/HW20240403_01g.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
           <li><p>\(x^2-4y^2-4=0\)</p>
               <p>This equation is not in standard form. We can put it in standard form as follows: \(x^2-4y^2-4=0\Rightarrow x^2-4y^2=4\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{4}-\frac{4y^2}{4}=1\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{4}-\frac{y^2}{1}=1.\) Since the positive term is the \(x\)-term, this is a hyperbola whose transverse axis is horizontal. We see that \(a=2\) and \(b=1,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{(2)^2+(1)^2}=\sqrt{5}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
               <p><img src="img/HW20240403_01h.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
           <li><p>\(\frac{y^2}{3}-2x^2-6=0\)</p>
               <p>This equation is not in standard form. We can put it in standard form as follows: \(\frac{y^2}{3}-2x^2-6=0\Rightarrow \frac{y^2}{3}-2x^2=6\Rightarrow \frac{y^2}{18}-\frac{2x^2}{6}=1\Rightarrow \frac{y^2}{18}-\frac{x^2}{3}=1.\) Since the positive term is the \(y\)-term, this is a hyperbola whose transverse axis is vertical. We see that \(a=\sqrt{18}\) and \(b=\sqrt{3},\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{(\sqrt{18})^2+(\sqrt{3})^2}=\sqrt{21}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
