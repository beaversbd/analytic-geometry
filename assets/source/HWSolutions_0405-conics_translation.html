              <p>This equation is in the standard form of a leftward opening parabola with \(h=0,\) \(k=1,\) and \(c=\frac{3}{2}.\) Thus the vertex is \((0,1)\), the focus is \(\frac{3}{2}\) units left from the vertex at \(\left(-\frac{3}{2},1\right),\) the directrix is the vertical line \(\frac{3}{2}\) units right from the vertex, \(x=\frac{3}{2}\), and the axis of symmetry is the horizontal line through the vertex, \(y=1.\)</p>

              <p>This equation is in the standard form for an ellipse that has a vertical major axis, and we can see that \(h=1,\) \(k=2,\) \(a=4,\) and \(b=3.\) Thus \(c=\sqrt{(4)^2-(3)^2}=\sqrt{7}.\) The center is at \((1,2),\) the vertices are \(4\) units up and down from the center at \((1,6)\) and \((1,-2),\) the covertices are \(3\) units left and right from the center at \((-2,2)\) and \((4,2),\) and the foci are \(\sqrt{7}\) units up and down from the center at \((1,2+\sqrt{7})\) and \((1,2-\sqrt{7}).\) The major axis is the vertical line \(x=1\) through the center and the minor axis is the horizontal line \(y=2\) through the center.</p>

              <p>If we reverse the terms, this equation will be in the standard form for an ellipse that has a horizontal major axis, and we can see that \(h=0,\) \(k=3,\) \(a=4,\) and \(b=3.\) Thus \(c=\sqrt{(4)^2-(3)^2}=\sqrt{7}.\) The center is at \((0,3),\) the vertices are \(4\) units right and left from the center at \((4,3)\) and \((-4,3),\) the covertices are \(3\) units up and down from the center at \((0,6)\) and \((0,0),\) and the foci are \(\sqrt{7}\) units right and left from the center at \((-\sqrt{7},3)\) and \((\sqrt{7},3).\) The major axis is the horizontal line \(y=3\) through the center and the minor axis is the vertical line \(x=0\) through the center.</p>

            <li><p>\(\frac{(x-3)^2}{5}+\frac{(y+1)^2}{7}=1\)</p>
              <p>This equation is in the standard form for an ellipse that has a vertical major axis, and we can see that \(h=3,\) \(k=-1,\) \(a=\sqrt{7},\) and \(b=\sqrt{5}.\) Thus \(c=\sqrt{(\sqrt{7})^2-(\sqrt{5})^2}=\sqrt{2}.\) The center is at \((3,-1),\) the vertices are \(\sqrt{7}\) units up and down from the center at \((3,-1+\sqrt{7})\) and \((3,-1-\sqrt{7}),\) the covertices are \(\sqrt{5}\) units right and left from the center at \((3+\sqrt{5},-1)\) and \((3-\sqrt{5},-1),\) and the foci are \(\sqrt{2}\) units up and down from the center at \((3,-1+\sqrt{2})\) and \((3,-1-\sqrt{2}).\) The major axis is the vertical line \(x=3\) through the center and the minor axis is the horizontal line \(y=-1\) through the center.</p>
              <p><img src="img/HW20240405_01k.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Give standard form equations for conics that satisfy the given information:
          <ol type="a">
            <li><p><em>a circle that has a diameter whose endpoints are \((3,4)\) and \((5,4)\)</em></p>
                <p>To produce a standard form equation for a circle, we need the center and radius. The midpoint of this diameter must be the center of the circle: \((\frac{3+5}{2},\frac{4+4}{2})=(4,4).\) Half the length of the diameter must be the radius: \(\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(5-3)^2+(4-4)^2}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{4}=1.\) Thus a standard form equation of this circle is \((x-4)^2+(y-4)^2=1.\)</p></li>
            <li><p><em>a parabola with focus \((3,5)\) and directrix \(x=-1\)</em></p>
                <p>To get a standard form equation for a parabola, we need to know the direction of the parabola, the vertex, and the value of \(c.\) The distance from the focus to the directrix is (5--1=6\), and \(c\) must be half this value: \(c=3.\) The vertex is the point halfway between the focus and directrix on the line perpendicular to the directrix through the focus: \((3,2).\) Finally, since the directrix is horizontal and below the focus, the parabola opens upward. Thus a standard form equation of this parabola is \((x-3)^2=4(3)(y-2),\) or just \((x-3)^2=12(y-2).\)</p></li>
            <li><p><em>an ellipse with vertices \((-1,8)\) and \((-1,-2)\) which contains the point \((1,0)\)</em></p>
                <p>To get a standard form equation for an ellipse, we need to know the center, whether the major axis is vertical or horizontal, the value of \(a,\) and the value of \(b.\) We are given the vertices, and we know that the center is the midpoint of the segment through the vertices: \(\left(\frac{-1+-1}{2},\frac{8+-2}{2}\right)=\left(-1,3\right).\) The line through the vertices and the center have the same \(x\)-value, so the major axis is the vertical line \(x=-1.\) The distance from the center to each vertex is \(5,\) and so \(a=5.\) So far, we know that our major axis is vertical, \(a=5\), \(h=-1,\) and \(k=3;\) all that remains is to find \(b.\)  Our equation so far is \(\frac{(x+1)^2}{b^2}+\frac{(y-3)^2}{25}=1.\) The only other piece of information we have is that \((1,0)\) is on the graph, but we know that if we substitute \(1\) for \(x\) and \(0\) for \(y\) in our equation, the resulting equation will be true, and that will let us find \(b:\) \(\frac{(1+1)^2}{b^2}+\frac{(0-3)^2}{25}=1\Rightarrow \frac{4}{b^2}+\frac{9}{25}=1\Rightarrow \frac{4}{b^2}=\frac{16}{25}\Rightarrow b^2=\frac{100}{16}=\frac{25}{4}.\) Thus a standard form equation of this ellipse is \(\frac{(x+1)^2}{\frac{25}{4}}+\frac{(y-3)^2}{25}=1.\)</p></li>
            <li><p><em>a hyperbola with vertices \((4,1)\) and \((0,1)\) and focus \((6,1)\)</em></p>
                <p>To get a standard form equation for a hyperbola, we need to know the center, whether the transverse axis is vertical or horizontal, the value of \(a,\) and the value of \(b.\) We are given the vertices, and the center will be the midpoint \((2,1)\) of these two vertices. The known vertices and focus are on the same horizontal line \(y=1,\) and so we know the transverse axis is the horizontal line \(y=1.\) The distance from the center to the vertices is \(2,\) and so \(a=2.\) The distance from the center to the focus is \(4,\) and so \(c=4.\) Since \(a=2\) and \(c=4\), we can find \(b=\sqrt{4^2-2^2}=\sqrt{12}.\) Thus a standard form equation of this hyperbola is \(\frac{(x-2)^2}{4}-\frac{(y-1)^2}{12}=1.\)</p></li>
            <li><p><em>a hyperbola with vertex \((6,-1)\) and asymptotes \(3x-2y-6\) and \(3x+2y-2=0\)</em></p>
                <p>To get a standard form equation for a hyperbola, we need to know the center, whether the transverse axis is vertical or horizontal, the value of \(a,\) and the value of \(b.\) The center is the intersection point of the asymptotes, so first we find the intersection points of the asymptotes: \(\left(\frac{4}{3},-1\right).\) The center and given vertex are on the same horizontal line \(y=-1,\) and so our transverse axis is the horizontal line \(y=-1.\) What remains is to find the values of \(a\) and \(b.\) The focus is \(6-\frac{4}{3}=\frac{14}{3}\) units from the center, so \(c=\frac{14}{3}\). Thus we know from \(c^2=a^2+b^2\) that \(\frac{196}{9}=a^2+b^2.\) The slopes of our asymptotes are \(\pm\frac{3}{2},\) and so we also know that \(\frac{b}{a}=\frac{3}{2}.\) Thus we have two equations in two unknowns: \(a^2+b^2=\frac{196}{9}\) and \(\frac{b}{a}=\frac{3}{2},\) which we can solve for \(a\) and \(b\). First, rewrite \(\frac{b}{a}=\frac{3}{2}\) as \(b=\frac{3}{2}a\) and then substitute into \(a^2+b^2=\frac{196}{9}\): \(a^2+(\frac{3}{2}a)^2=\frac{196}{9}.\) Then \(\frac{13}{4}a^2=\frac{196}{9}.\) Then \(a^2=\frac{784}{117}.\) Then we can use \(a^2+b^2=\frac{196}{9}\) to solve for \(b^2\): \(\frac{784}{117}+b^2=\frac{196}{9}\Rightarrow b^2=\frac{196}{13}.\) Now that we have \(a^2\) and \(b^2\), we can write our equation: \(\frac{(x-\frac{4}{3})^2}{\frac{784}{117}}-\frac{(y+1)^2}{\frac{196}{13}}=1.\)</p></li>
