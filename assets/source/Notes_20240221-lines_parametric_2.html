<title>Lines: General Parametric Equation</title>
</head>

<body>
    
<div class="w3-container">

  <p>In the work above, we made sure that our parametric equation(s) started with the point \(A\) at \(t=0\) and went through \(B\) at \(t=1\). But what if we wanted to pass through those two points at different times? For example, what if we wanted to pass through point \(A(x_A,y_A)\) at \(t=t_A\) and pass through point \(B(x_B,y_B)\) at \(t=t_B\) where we could choose any number for \(t_A\) and \(t_B\) and any points \(A\) and \(B\)?</p>

  <p>Before we work in full generalization, let's work from a specific example. Suppose we want to go through point \(A=(2,1)\) at \(t=3\) and through point \(B=(8,3)\) at \(t=7\). We need two formulas, one for the \(x\)-coordinates and one for the \(y\)-coordinates. Let's work on the \(x\)-coordinate first. We want a formula where we plug in \(t=3\) and get \(x=2\) and then when we plug in \(t=7\) we get \(x=8\).</p>
  
  <p>This is effectively the same problem as considering the plane to be made from a \(t\)-axis and an \(x\)-axis and finding an equation \(x=f(t)\) for a line whose inputs are \(t\)-values and whose outputs are \(x\)-values. In particular the line would contain the \((t,x)\)-points \((3,2)\) and \((7,8).\) The idea here that would correspond to slope in our regular \(xy\)-plane is that of a <em>change in \(x\) with respect to time</em>, calculated \(\frac{x_B-x_A}{t_B-t_A}.\) Then we could use two-point form, which in the \(tx\)-plane would look like \(x-x_A=\frac{x_B-x_A}{t_B-t_A}(t-t_A).\)</p>

  <p>The meaning of the slope ratio here is how far we move in the \(x\) direction between point \(A\) and point \(B\) compared to how much time passes, \(t_B-t_A.\) It's really the same idea as <em>speed</em>: the ratio of distance traveled to the time needed to travel that distance. Let's write the change in \(x\)-value from \(A\) to \(B\) as \(\Delta x\), which we calculate as \(x_B-x_A\), and let's write the change in \(t\)-value as \(\Delta t\), which we calculate as \(t_B-t_A.\) Then the slope \(\frac{x_B-x_A}{t_B-t_A}\) can be expressed as \(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}.\)</p>

  <p>Now let's take our two point form \(x-x_A=\frac{x_B-x_A}{t_B-t_A}(t-t_A)\) and make two tweaks: (1) write the slope as \(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\) and (2) move \(x_A\) to the right hand side. After doing that, we get the following: \(x=x_A+\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}(t-t_A)\); this is our general formula to find the \(x\)-coordinate of our point from its \(t\)-value.</p>
  
  <p>Let's go back to the problem at hand. We ant to plug in \(3\) for \(t\) to get the \(x\)-value of \(2\), and we want to plug in the \(t\)-value of \(7\) to get the \(x\)-value of \(8\). An equation that does that is \(x=2+\frac{8-2}{7-3}(t-3),\), which simplifies to \(x=2+\frac{6}{4}(t-3),\) or can be simplified even further to \(x=\frac{3}{2}t-\frac{5}{2}.\) Thus instead of having a rate of change of \(6\) \(x\)-units per \(1\) \(t\)-unit, we need a rate of change of \(6\) \(x\)-units per \(4\) \(t\)-units. When we use either of these simplified equations, notice that \(x=2\) at \(t=3\) but also that \(x=8\) when \(t=7\). This formula does what we wanted!</p>

  <p>We can also adjust the \(y\) formula in a similar way using \(y=y_A+\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}(t-t_A).\): we get \(y=1+\frac{2}{4}(t-3).\). In this formula, we get \(y=1\) when \(t=3\) and \(y=3\) when \(t=7\).Thus in the equation \((x,y)=(2+\frac{6}{4}(t-3),1+\frac{2}{4}(t-3))\), we get a line that passes through \((2,1)\) at \(t=3\) and through \((8,3)\) at \(t=7\), just as we had wanted!</p>
  
  <p>Notice that this is very similar to the formula we had last time. The main difference is that the coefficient of the \((t-t_A)\) factor, the <em>rate of change</em>, involves both \(x\) or \(y\) and \(t\). That's because last time we used \(t=0\) and \(t=1\) for our points, making \(\Delta t\) just \(1.\) Now we can have our two points at any time we want!</p>

  <p>Since we already have \(\Delta x\) (run) and \(\Delta y\) (rise), we can use them to find the slope: \(m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\), and once we have the slope, we can find the inclination. We can also use what we already know about parametric equations to find any \(x\)-intercepts and any \(y\)-intercepts.</p>

      <h4>General Parametric Equation for a Line</h4>
    </header>
    <div class="w3-container"><p>Suppose \(A(x_A,y_A)\) and \(B(x_B,y_B)\) are two points on a line and we want parametric equations of this line where we get the point \(A\) at \(t=t_A\) and the point \(B\) at \(t=t_B\). The <em>run</em> \(\Delta x\) from \(A\) to \(B\) is \(x_B-x_A\), the <em>rise</em> \(\Delta y\) from \(A\) to \(B\) is \(y_B-y_A\), and the <em>time difference</em> \(\Delta t\) is \(t_B-t_A\).</p>
    <p>We can express the line using the parameter \(t\) as follows:\[(x,y)=\left(x_A+\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}(t-t_A),y_A+\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}(t-t_A)\right).\]
    </p>
    <p>We can also write this using the pair of equations 
      \[\begin{cases} x=x_A+\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}(t-t_A) \\ y=y_A+\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}(t-t_A) \end{cases}.\]</p>
    
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>The slope of this line (if it exists) is \(m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.\)</li>
        <li>The inclination \(\theta\) satisfies the equation \(\tan\theta=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\).</li>
        <li>We may find the \(x\)-intercept and \(y\)-intercept (if they exist) using standard parametric methods (set the \(x\) or \(y\) formula equal to zero, solve for the relevant \(t\)-value, and then substitute back into the other equation to get the other coordinate).</li>
