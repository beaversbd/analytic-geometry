<p>To get polar equations for our conic sections, we need to discuss the
concept of <em>eccentricity</em> and discover a way to have directrices
for hyperbolas and ellipses as well as parabolas.</p>
<h3
id="eccentricityfocusdirectrix-definition-of-the-conics">Eccentricity/Focus/Directrix
Definition of the Conics</h3>
<p>Earlier in the semester we used two ways to define our nondegenerate
conic sections. For hyperbolas and ellipses, we defined them using a
fixed sum or difference between a point and the two vertices. However,
for parabolas, which have only one focus, we defined its points as
having the same distance from the focus as the directrix. It turns out
that we can use a focus/directrix definition for ellipses and hyperbolas
as well!</p>
<p>First, note that for the parabola, we said that the distance from
each point on the graph to the focus is equal to the distance from that
point to the directrix. In other words, the ratio of these distances
must be exactly \(1\). For the ellipse and hyperbola, we will identify
two directrices and fix the ratio of the distances from a point to the a
focus and the point to a directrix. This ratio is called the
<strong><em>eccentricity</em></strong> \(e\) of the conic section.</p>
Focus/Directrix Definition of the Ellipse
<p>Consider the ellipse centered at the origin with equation
\(\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1\) and let \(e=\frac{a}{c}\). It can
be proved that this ratio \(e\) is the eccentricity as described above.
If we rearrange the equation \(e=\frac{a}{c}\), we get \(c=ae\). Since
\(c&lt; a\), it must be the case that \(e&lt; 1\). Since
\(a^2=b^2+c^2\), we can also prove that \(b^2=a^2(1-e^2)\). So when
\(e=0\), we have that \(a=b\) and the ellipse degenerates to a circle.
Thus we go forward with the assumption that \(0&lt; e&lt; 1\) for
ellipses.</p>
<p>Let us now define the <strong><em>directrices of an
ellipse</em></strong> to be the two lines perpendicular to the major
axis at a distance of \(a/e\) from the center of the ellipse. Recall
also that \(c=ae\). Thus we get two foci \((\pm ae,0)\) and two
directrices \(x=\pm\frac{a}{e}\) for our ellipse with a horizontal major
axis.</p>
Focus/Directrix Definition of the Hyperbola
<p>Consider the hyperbola centered at the origin with equation
\(\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1\) and let \(e=\frac{a}{c}\). It can
be proved that this ratio \(e\) is the eccentricity as described above.
If we rearrange the equation \(e=\frac{a}{c}\), we get \(c=ae\). Since
\(a&lt; c\), it must be the case that \(e&gt; 1\) for hyperbolas. Since
\(c^2=a^2+b^2\), we can also prove that \(b^2=a^2(e^2-1)\).</p>
<p>Let us now define the <strong><em>directrices of a
hyperbola</em></strong> to be the two lines perpendicular to the major
axis at a distance of \(a/e\) from the center of the ellipse. Recall
also that \(c=ae\). Thus we get two foci \((\pm ae,0)\) and two
directrices \(x=\pm\frac{a}{e}\) for our hyperbola with a horizontal
transverse axis.</p>
Focus/Directrix Definition of the Parabola, Revisited
<p>Earlier we defined the parabola to be the shape where the distance
from any point to the focus is equal to the distance from that point to
the directrix. Thus the ratio of these distances, is \(1\), which we
also take to be the eccentricity. We identified a parameter \(c\) as the
distance from the vertex to the focus and to the directrix. For the
parabola, \(a=c\) and the vertex also serves as the center. Thus for the
parabola, the focus and directrix are at a distance of \(c=ae\) from the
vertex/center on the axis of symmetry.</p>
<h4
id="eccentricities-for-the-three-nondegenerate-conics">Eccentricities
for the Three Nondegenerate Conics</h4>
<p>Notice that the eccentricity determines our conic: we have an ellipse
when \(0&lt; e&lt; 1\), we have a parabola when \(e=1\) and we have a
hyperbola when \(e&gt; 1\). Parabolas only have one directrix, while
ellipses and hyperbolas have two.</p>
<h3 id="deriving-the-polar-equations-for-conic-sections">Deriving the
Polar Equations for Conic Sections</h3>
<p>To derive an equation for conic sections using polar coordinates, we
set a focus to be at the pole \((0,0^\circ)\). First, let's assume our
major axis/transverse axis/axis of symmetry is the polar axis
\(r=0^\circ\). Thus one of our directrices is a vertical line to the
left of the pole; let's say that the distance is \(q\) from the pole to
the directrix. For a point \(P=(r,\theta)\) on the conic with
eccentricity \(e\), the ratio of the distance from \(P\) to the focus to
the distance from \(P\) to the directrix. The distance from \(P\) to the
focus is just \(r\) and the distance from \(P\) to the focus is just
\(q+r\cos\theta\). Thus \[e=\frac{r}{q+r\cos\theta}.\]</p>
<p>Solving this equation for \(r\) gives us
\[r=\frac{eq}{1-e\cos\theta}.\]</p>
<p>What if we wanted a vertical ellipse or hyperbola, or a parabola that
opens left, up, or down? In that case, we can adjust our assumptions and
derive some other forms. Let's summarize all the options:</p>
