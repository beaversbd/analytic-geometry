# Analytic Geometry: An Opinionated Precalculus Course

Stephen F. Austin State University has a track to calculus that contains a plane analytic geometry course. Having such a course is relatively uncommon, but has several advantages in preparing students for calculus. These notes take traditional analytic geometry topics and weave them in a new way. Parametric equations and polar coordinates are integrated at relevant locations instead of being relegated to their own separate chapters. There is an emphasis on reviewing concepts of plane geometry that students often have not seen since high school geometry. Justification for all the main ideas are included so that students can see the reasons why formulas work. I hope this presentation is a unique way of turning a stale outdated analytic geometry course into a cutting-edge, practical, and rich precalculus course.
