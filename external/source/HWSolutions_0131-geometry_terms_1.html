      <p>Complete the following homework problems for Wednesday, January 31. Where appropriate, show work that justifies your answers for full credit.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><p><em>Plot the points \((1,2)\) and \((4,6)\). Find a third point that makes a right triangle with these two given points as the endpoints of the hypotenuse. Verify that the distance between the two points is the same as the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle you created.</em></p>
          <p>We can make a right triangle including \((1,2)\) and \((4,6)\) by using vertical and horizontal sides (because vertical lines are perpendicular to horizontal lines). That makes a point directly to the right of \((1,2)\) and directly down from \((4,6)\) a good candidate. Thus we pick \((4,2)\) as our third vertex (you could also use \((1,6)\)). The distance from \((1,2)\) to \((4,2)\) is \(3\) units and the distance from \((4,6)\) to \((4,2)\) is \(4\) units. The Pythagorean theorem then says that the hypotenuse has length \(\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5\). The distance formula says that the distance from \((1,2)\) to \((4,6)\) is \(\sqrt{(4-1)^2+(6-2)^2}=\sqrt{9+16}=5\), and that is the same as the length of the hypotenuse as calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem. <img src="img/HW20240131_01.png" /></p></li>
        <li><p><em>Without using slopes or equations of lines, determine whether the points \((-2,3)\), \((0,1)\), and \((2,5)\) colinear or not. Explain how you know.</em></p>
            <p>NOTE: the <strong><em>triangle inequality</em></strong> (see the notes) tells us that three points form a triangle if and only if the sum of the lengths of each pair of sides is larger than the length of the third side. When we have three points, they are either collinear or a triangle. As a result, we can know that three points are collinear when we calculate the distances between each pair of points and the sum of the two smaller distances is equal to the longest distance.</p>
            <p>The distance between \((-2,3)\) and \((0,1)\) is \(\sqrt{(-2-0)^2+(3-1)^2}=\sqrt{8}\). The distance between \((0,1)\) and \((2,5)\) is \(\sqrt{(0-2)^2+(1-5)^2}=\sqrt{20}\). The distance between \((-2,3)\) and \((2,5)\) is \(\sqrt{(-2-2)^2+(3-5)^2}=\sqrt{20}\). Since \(\sqrt{8}+\sqrt{20}\gt\sqrt{20}\), these three points form a triangle and are <strong><em>not collinear</em></strong>.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Without using slopes or equations of lines, determine whether the points \((1,7)\), \((0,3)\), and \((-2,-5)\) colinear or not. Explain how you know.</em></p>
            <p>The distance between \((1,7)\) and \((0,3)\) is \(\sqrt{(1-0)^2+(7-3)^2}=\sqrt{17}\). The distance between \((0,3)\) and \((-2,-5)\) is \(\sqrt{(0--2)^2+(3--5)^2}=\sqrt{68}=2\sqrt{17}\). The distance between \((1,7)\) and \((-2,-5)\) is \(\sqrt{(1--2)^2+(7--5)^2}=\sqrt{153}=3\sqrt{17}\). Since \(\sqrt{17}+2\sqrt{17}=3\sqrt{17}\), these three points do not form a triangle and <strong><em>are collinear</em></strong>.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Are the points \((9,6)\), \((-5,4)\), and \((7,10)\) the vertices of a right triangle or not? Explain how you know.</em></p>
            <p>NOTE: the Pythagorean theorem and its converse tell us that a triangle is a right triangle if and only if its side lengths satisfy the equation \(a^2+b^2=c^2\). So if the side lengths satisfy the equation, then the triangle is a right triangle, and if the side lengths do not satisfy the equation, then the triangle is not a right triangle.</p>
            <p>The lengths of the three sides are \(\sqrt{(9--5)^2+(6-4)^2}=\sqrt{200}\), \(\sqrt{(-5-7)^2+(4-10)^2}=\sqrt{180}\), and \(\sqrt{(9-7)^2+(6-10)^2}=\sqrt{20}.\) Since the equation \((\sqrt{20})^2+(\sqrt{180})^2=(\sqrt{200})^2\) is true, this must be a right triangle.</p></li>    
        <li><p><em>Are the points \((-2,1)\), \((-1,-5)\), and \((2,-3)\) the vertices of a right triangle or not? Explain how you know.</em></p>
            <p>The lengths of the three sides are \(\sqrt{(-2--1)^2+(1--5)^2}=\sqrt{37}\), \(\sqrt{(-1-2)^2+(-5--3)^2}=\sqrt{13}\), and \(\sqrt{(-2-2)^2+(1--3)^2}=\sqrt{32}.\) Since the equation \((\sqrt{13})^2+(\sqrt{32})^2=(\sqrt{37})^2\) is false, this is not a right triangle.</p></li>
