<title>Lines: Distance from a Point to a Line</title>
</head>

<body>
    
<div class="w3-container">

<p>Our last geometric property to explore using equations of lines will be <em>the distance from a point to a line</em>.</p>

<p>This distance from a point to a line is a bit tricky to define. There are infinitely many points on a line, so we have to choose which point to measure from. What is fixed, however, is the perpendicular distance between two parallel lines. So the distance from a point to a line is the same distance as the distance between our original line and the line that passes through our point of interest that is parallel to the original line.</p>

<p>It turns out that the easiest form of a line to use here is a line in <em>general form</em> \(Ax+By+C=0;\) this is our first time for finding this form to be more useful than slope-intercept or intercept forms. Let's start with knowing the general form for our given line \(l_1:Ax+By+C=0\) and the coordinates of our point \(P_0(x_1,y_2)\)</p>

<p>First, we note that the line \(l_2:Ax+By-(Ax_1+By_1)=0\) is parallel to \(l_1:Ax+By+C=0\) and goes through the point \(P(x_1,y_1)\). How do we know they are parallel? If we solve both for \(y\), we see that the slopes are both \(-\frac{A}{B}\). How do we know that \(P\) is on \(l_2\)? We can substitute \(x_1\) for \(x\) and \(y_1\) for \(y\) and the resulting equation is true.</p>

<p>Next, we note that the line \(l_3:Bx-Ay=0\) is perpendicular to both \(l_1:Ax+By+C=0\) and \(l_2:Ax+By-(Ax_1+By_1)=0\). How do we know that \(Bx-Ay=0\) is perpendicular to \(l_1\) and \(l_2?\) The slope of \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) is \(-\frac{A}{B}\) and the slope of \(l_3\) is \(\frac{B}{A},\) and these two are opposite reciprocals.</p>

<p>Let \(P\) be the intersection point of \(Bx-Ay=0\) with \(Ax+By+C=0\) and let \(Q\) be the intersection point of \(Bx-Ay=0\) with \(Ax+By-(Ax_1+By_1)=0\). Since the lines \(Ax+By+C=0\) and \(Ax+By-(Ax_1+By_1)=0\) are parallel, the distance between \(P\) and \(Q\) is the same as the distance between \((x_1,y_1)\) and \(Ax+By+C=0\).</p>

  <p>Now we need coordinates for \(P\) and \(Q\). Using standard solution methods, we can calculate that \(P=(\frac{-AC}{A^2+B^2},\frac{-BC}{A^2+B^2})\) and \(Q=(\frac{A(Ax_1+By_1)}{A^2+B^2},\frac{B(Ax_1+By_1)}{A^2+B^2}).\)</p>

  <p>Finally, we can use the distance formula to find the distance between \(P\) and \(Q\):
    \[
    \begin{align}
       d & = \sqrt{\left(\frac{A(Ax_1+By_1)}{A^2+B^2}-\frac{-AC}{A^2+B^2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{B(Ax_1+By_1)}{A^2+B^2}-\frac{-BC}{A^2+B^2}\right)^2} \\
         & = \sqrt{\frac{(Ax_1+By_1+C)^2}{A^2+B^2}} \\
         & = \frac{|Ax_1+By_1+C|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. 
    \end{align}
    \]</p>

  <p>This has simplified nicely! If you look closely at the formula, the numerator is what you get from plugging \(x_1\) and \(y_1\) in for \(x\) and \(y\) in our original line equation! Don't forget the absolute value bars - that's what makes our expression a nonnegative value!</p>
