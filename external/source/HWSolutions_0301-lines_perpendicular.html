      <ol type="1">
        <li>Determine whether the lines are perpendicular or not.
          <ol type="a">
            <li><p>\(y=2x+3\) and \(y=3x+2\)</p>
                <p>The slopes of these two lines are \(2\) and \(3\), which are not opposite reciprocals. Thus, these two lines are not perpendicular.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(y=2x+4\) and \(y=2x+5\)</p>
                <p>The slopes of these two lines are both \(2\), which are not opposite reciprocals. Thus, these two lines are not perpendicular</p></li>
            <li><p>\(3x+2y=6\) and \(2x-3y=4\)</p>
                <p>The slopes of these two lines are \(-3/2\) and \(2/3\), which are opposite reciprocals. Thus, these two lines are perpendicular.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(x=2\) and \(y=3\)</p>
                <p>One line is vertical and the other is horizontal. Thus, these two lines are perpendicular.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(0x+3y=6\) and \(0x+y=2\)</p>
                <p>These equations represent the same line: the horizontal line \(y=2.\) Thus, these two lines are not perpendicular.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(y-1=2(x+3)\) and \(y-1=-\frac{1}{2}(x+3)\)</p>
                <p>The slopes of these lines are \(2\) and \(-1/2\), which are opposite reciprocals. Thus, these two lines are perpendicular.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(2x+4y=8\) and \(y=-\frac{1}{2}x+2\)</p>
              <p>These equations represent the same line: the oblique line \(y=-\frac{1}{2}x+2.\) Thus, these two lines are not perpendicular.</p></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Give an equation for the line through \((1,2)\) that is perpendicular to \(y=3x+5\).</em></p>
            <p>The desired line contains the point \((1,2)\), and because it is perpendicular to \(y=3x+5\), it has a slope of \(-1/3.\) Thus one such equation is \(y-2=-\frac{1}{3}(x-1).\)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Use slopes to give an equation for the perpendicular bisector of the line segment with endpoints \((-2,3)\) and \((3,5)\).</em></p>
            <p>The perpendicular bisector of the line segment will be the line that intersects the segment at a right angle through its midpoint. The midpoint of the line segment is \(\left(\frac{-2+3}{2},\frac{3+5}{2}\right)=\left(\frac{1}{2},4\right).\) The slope of the line segment is \(\frac{5-3}{3--2}=\frac{2}{5},\) and so the slope of the perpendicular bisector is the opposite reciprocal \(-\frac{5}{2}.\) Thus an equation of the perpendicular bisector is \(y-4=-\frac{5}{2}(x-\frac{1}{2}).\)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>If the line through \((a,5)\) and \((4,3)\) is perpendicular to a line with slope 3, the value of \(a\).</em></p>
            <p>Since the line through those two points is perpendicular to a line with slope \(3\), the line through those points has a slope of \(-1/3.\) Thus \(\frac{5-3}{a-4}=-\frac{1}{3}.\) Thus \(3\cdot(a-4)=-2.\). Thus \(3a-12=-2.\). Thus \(a=10/3.\)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Are the points \((9,6)\), \((-5,4)\), and \((7,10)\) the vertices of a right triangle or not? Use slopes to decide. Explain how you know.</em></p>
            <p>The slopes of the three sides are \(\frac{6-4}{9--5}=\frac{1}{7},\) \(\frac{6-10}{9-7}=-2,\) and \(\frac{10-4}{7--5}=\frac{1}{2}.\) Two of the three sides have opposite reciprical slopes. so those two sides are perpendicular, making this a right triangle.</p></li>    
        <li><p><em>Are the points \((-2,1)\), \((-1,-5)\), and \((2,-3)\) the vertices of a right triangle or not? Use slopes to decide. Explain how you know.</em></p>
          <p>The slopes of the three sides are \(\frac{1--5}{-2--1}=-6,\) \(\frac{1--3}{-2-2}=-1,\) and \(\frac{-5--3}{-1-2}=\frac{2}{3}.\) No two of the three sides have opposite reciprical slopes, and so no sides are perpendicular. Thus, this is not a right triangle.</p></li>    
        <li><p><em>Use slopes to show that \((1,2)\), \((4,7)\), \((-6,13)\) and \((-9,8)\) are the vertices of a rectangle.</em></p>
            <p>The slope of the top side is \(\frac{13-7}{-6-4}=-\frac{3}{5}\) and the slope on the bottom side is \(\frac{8-2}{-9-1}=-\frac{3}{5}.\). Since these are the same, the top and bottom sides are parallel. The slope of the left side is \(\frac{13-8}{-6--9}=\frac{5}{3},\) and the slope on the right side is \(\frac{7-2}{4-1}=\frac{5}{3}.\) Since these are the same, the left and right sides are parallel. Since opposite sides are parallel, this is a parallelogram. To know it is a rectangle, we just need to check that adjacent sides meet at a rigth angle. The slopes of the two pairs of sides are opposite reciprocals, and so adjacent sides are perpendicular. Therefore, this is a rectangle. </p></li>
        <li><p><em>Use slopes to show that \((3,3)\), \((0,2)\), \(\left(\frac{9}{5},-\frac{3}{5}\right)\), and \(\left(\frac{24}{5},\frac{2}{5}\right)\) are the vertices of a rhombus. The easiest way to do this is to use the fact that a shape is a rhombus if and only if it is a parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals.</em></p>
            <p>The slopes of the top and bottom sides are both \(1/3,\) making these two opposite sides parallel. The slopes of the left and right sides are both \(-\frac{13}{9},\) making these two opposite sides parallel. The slopes of the diagonals are opposite recipricals \(-1/3\) and \(3,\) making these segments perpendicular. Since opposite sides are parallel and diagonals are perpendicular, this must be a rhombus.</p></li>
