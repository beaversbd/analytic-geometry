<title>Analytic Geometry in the Plane | Geometry Terms and Problems</title>
</head>

<body>
    
<div class="w3-container">

  <p>As we saw when discussing the idea of a midpoint of a line segment in the plane, there are a lot of concepts that are defined geometrically and we now want to give an algebraic way of thinking about them as well. We'll need to review some geometry terms and formulas to make full use of this idea.</p>

      <h3>Points, Lines, and Angles</h3>
    </header>
      
    <div class="w3-container">
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong><em>point</em></strong> is represented by a dot. It has a location (coordinates) but no area, length, width, or other properties. It is represented by an upper-case letter like \(P\), \(Q\), \(A\), \(B\), etc.</li>
        <li>Any pair of points, say \(A\) and \(B\), determine a unique (straight) line.
          <ul>
            <li>A line is usually named by a lower-case letter like \(l\) or by the two points we know on the line with a double-arrow above them: \(\overleftrightarrow{AB}\).</li>
            <li>All the points of the line between \(A\) and \(B\), inclusive, is called a <strong><em>line segment</em></strong>, and it is denoted by a bar over the point names: \(\overline{AB}\). The points \(A\) and \(B\) are called <strong><em>endpoints</em></strong> of the line segment.</li>
            <li>All the points of the line on the same side of \(A\) as \(B\) is called a <strong><em>ray</em></strong> and is denoted by a single-arrow line over the point name: \(\overrightarrow{AB}\). The point \(A\) is called an endpoint of the ray.</li>
            <li>The <strong><em>length</em></strong> of a line segment, also defined as the distance between the two points, is denoted by the pair of letters with nothing on top: \(AB\). Two line segments are geometrically identical, or <strong><em>congruent</em></strong>, when they have the same length.</li>
            <li>A <strong><em>bisector</em></strong> of a line or an angle is a geometric object that divides the given line or angle into two congruent halves. We can bisect a line with its midpoint or a line through the midpoint. We can bisect an angle with a ray.</li>
            <li>A set of points is said to be <strong><em>collinear</em></strong> of they are all on the same line.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>An <strong><em>angle</em></strong> is formed when two rays \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{AC}\) share a common endpoint called the <strong><em>vertex</em></strong> of the angle. Such an angle is usually denoted by \(\angle BAC\) where the vertex is the middle letter of the three.</li>
        <li>The measure (size) of an angle is usually expressed in units like <em>rotations</em>, <em>revolutions</em>, <em>degrees</em>, and <em>radians</em>. Two angles are congruent when they have the same measure.</li>
        <li>An <strong><em>acute</em></strong> angle is an angle whose measure is between \(0^\circ\) and \(90^\circ\).</li>
        <li>A <strong><em>right</em></strong> angle is an angle whose measure is exactly \(90^\circ.\)</li>
        <li>An <strong><em>obtuse</em></strong> angle is an angle whose measure is between \(90^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\).</li>
        <li><strong><em>Supplementary</em></strong> angles are a pair of angles whose measure sum to exactly \(180^\circ\).</li>
        <li><strong><em>Complementary</em></strong> angles are a pair of angles whose measure sum to exactly \(90^\circ\).</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/linearpair.html">Linear Pair</a>: If two angles are a linear pair, then they are supplementary. </li>
        <li>A <a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/anglestraight.html">straight angle</a> has angle measure of \(180^\circ\).</li>
        <li>Two lines are <strong><em>parallel</em></strong> if there is no point that is on both lines.</li>
        <li>Two lines <strong><em>intersect</em></strong> if they have one and only one point in common.</li>
        <li>Two lines are <strong><em>perpendicular</em></strong> if they intersect and the angles formed at the intersection are right angles. (Note: when at least one angle at an intersection point is a right angle, then all of the angles at the intersection point must be right angles.) </li>
        <li>Transversal:
          Given that a pair lines are intersected by a <a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/transversal.html">transversal</a>, then the following are true:
          <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/anglesalternateinterior.html">Alternate interior angles are congruent if and only if the lines are parallel.</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/anglesalternateexterior.html">Alternate exterior angles are congruent if and only if the lines are parallel. </a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/anglescorresponding.html">Corresponding angles are congruent if and only if the lines are parallel. </a></li>

      <h3>Strategies for Geometric Problems</h3>
    </header>
      
    <div class="w3-container">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Converse of the Pythagorean theorem</strong> : the Pythagorean theorem says that "if we have a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length \(c\) and whose legs have length \(a\) and \(b\), then \(a^2+b^2=c^2\). However, the converse is also true: "if we have a triangle whose side lengths satisfy the equation \(a^2+b^2=c^2\), then the (1) the triangle is a right triangle, (2) \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse, and (3) \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs. Thus if we have three points in the plane, we can tell if they are the vertices of a right triangle or not by testing the distances by using the Pythagorean theorem and its converse. This can also be used to determine if two lines are perpendicular or not.</li>
        <li><strong>The Triangle Inequality</strong>: note that when we have three points, either they all fall on the same line (are collinear), or they form the vertices of a triangle, but not both. We can pair the three points up into three distinct pairs. Three points are the vertices of a triangle (instead of being collinear) if and only if the sum of the distances between the points in two of the pairs is larger than the distance between the points in the other pair. A consequence of this is that if the sum of the distances between the points in two of the pairs is exactly equal to the distance between the points of the third pair, then the three points do not form a triangle; rather, they must all lie on the same line (that is, are <em>colinear</em>). This is a useful way to determine if three points are colinear or not.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallelograms</strong>: parallelograms are very useful geometric objects. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral where both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. One important theorem says that a quadrilateral is a parallelogram if and only if its opposite sides have the same length. Thus you can determine if a shape is a parallelogram or not just by finding side lengths.</li>
        <li><strong>Rectangles</strong>: A rectangle is a parallelogram that has at least one right angle. We can tell if four points form a rectangle by (1) first checking that they form a parallelogram, and then (2) finding a right angle. There are several other alternative characterizations of rectangles (listed above) that we can use instead. Notice the one that gives us a way to check that does not require us to use angles at all: opposite sides are congruent (same length) and diagonals are congruent (same length).</li>
        <li><strong>Rhombus</strong>: A rhombus is a parallelogram where all four sides are the same length. This is easy to determine using the distance formula.</li>
        <li><strong>Square</strong>: A square is a quadrilateral that is both a rectangle and a rhombus. To prove that a shape is a square, we need to know that all four sides are the same length and there is at least one right angle. Alternatively, using the equivalences above, we could just check that all four sides have the same length and the diagonals have the same length.</li>
