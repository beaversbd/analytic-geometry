      <p>Complete the following homework problems for Monday, January 29. Where appropriate, show work that justifies your answers for full credit.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><em>Give the coordinates of three points that are in the second quadrant and plot them in the Cartesian plane.</em> Answers will vary, but all answers should have negative \(x\)-coordinates and positive \(y\)-coordinates, such as \((-2,1)\), \((-5,3)\), and \((-1,5).\) <p><img src="img/HW20240129_01.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
        <li><em>Give the coordinates of three points that are in none of the four quadrants and plot them in the Cartesian plane.</em> Answers will vary, but all answers should be on the \(x\)-axis or \(y\)-axis, such as \((0,0)\), \((-2,0)\) and \((0,3).\) <p><img src="img/HW20240129_02.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
        <li><em>Give the coordinates of both points on the vertical line that goes through \((2,3)\) that are at a distance of \(5\) units from \((2,3).\)</em> See the picture below. Points on the same vertical line as \((2,3)\) would be directly above or below. The point \(5\) units above is \((2,8)\) and the point \(5\) units below is \((2,-2).\) <p><img src="img/HW20240129_03.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
        <li><em>Find the exact distance (no rounding!) between the points \((2,1)\) and \((-2,-5)\).</em> For this, we use the distance formula: \(\sqrt{(2--2)^2+(1--5)^2}=\sqrt{16+36}=\sqrt{52}.\) The distance is \(\sqrt{52}.\)
        <li><em>What are the value(s) of \(x\) such that the distance from the point \((x,2)\) to \((4,6)\) is \(5\)?</em> The values of \(x\) that answer the problem will satisfy the following equation we set up using the distance formula: \(\sqrt{(x-4)^2+(2-6)^2}=5\). Now we solve:
          \[\begin{align} 
          \sqrt{(x-4)^2+(2-6)^2}&=5 \\
          (x-4)^2+(2-6)^2&=25 \\
          (x-4)^2+16&=25 \\ 
          (x-4)^2&=9\\
          x-4&=\pm 3 \\
          x&=4\pm 3 \\
          x&=7\text{ or } 1.
        \end{align}\] Both of these values work (the distance from \((7,2)\) to \((-2,-5)\) and from \((1,2)\) to \((-2,-5)\) are indeed \(5\)), so \(x=7\) and \(x=1\) are our solutions.</li>
        <li><em>The midpoint of the line segment through \((-2,5)\) and \((4,-1)\) is \((1,2)\). Use the distance formula to verify that the distance from \((-2,5)\) to \((1,2)\) is the same as the distance from \((4, -1)\) to \((1,2)\).</em> We will compute the two distances using the distance formula and *should* get the same result. Let's see... The distance from \((-2,5)\) to \((1,2)\) is \(\sqrt{(-2-1)^2+(5-2)^2}=\sqrt{18}\). The distance from \((4,-1)\) to \((1,2)\) is \(\sqrt{(4-1)^2+(-1-2)^2}=\sqrt{18}.\) Both distances are equal, as we expected. This confirms that \((1,2)\) is the midpoint of the line segment with ends at \((-2,5)\) and \((4,-1)\).</li>
