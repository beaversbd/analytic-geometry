<title>Lines: Basic Parametric Equations</title>

<div class="w3-container">

  <p>Today we will combine four ideas that we've been working on since the beginning of class:</p>

  <p>First, at the beginning of class we saw how to assign a real number to each point on a line:</p>

  <div class="w3-card-4">
    <header class="w3-container w3-2019-princess-blue">
      <h3>Axioms for One-Dimensional Analytic Geometry ("The Line")</h3>
    </header>
      
    <div class="w3-container">
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Each point on the line corresponds to a unique real number</li>
        <li>The distance between points corresponding to the real numbers \(x\) and \(y\) is \(|x-y|.\)</li>
        <li>The point corresponding to the real number \(x\) is to the left of the point corresponding to the real number \(y\) if and only if \(x&lt;y.\)</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Second, we have seen that we can use equations to describe geometric objects in the Cartesian/rectangular coordinate system. A point \((a,b)\) is on the graph of an equation if, when we substitute \(a\) for \(x\) and \(b\) for ]\(y\) into the given equation, the resulting numerical equation is true. In this case we also say that the point <em>satisfies</em> the equation. A point is not on the graph of an equation when its coordinates do not satisfy the equation. The concept of <em>intercepts</em> was important here.</p>

  <p>Third, we have seen that we can use a third variable, \(t\), representing time, to create parametric equations \((x,y)=(f(t),g(t))\). In general, these can be quite complicated, but the fundamental concept - that we use \(t\) to get both \(x\) and \(y\) - is relatively simple.</p>

  <p>Fourth, we have seen how to get equations of <em>lines</em> using equations in rectangular coordinates \(x\) and \(y\). <em>Slope</em> and <em>incliniation</em> were key concepts here.</p>

  <p>Now we will combine all four of these ideas to describe lines. What we want to do is find a way to have a correspondence between the real numbers and the points of a line in the Cartesian plane. Each point on the line will be associated with a real number \(t\) and coordinates \((x,y).\)</p>

  <p>In the graph below, watch the point move across the line and think there being a changing time \(t\) associated with the points of the line.</p>

  <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0hwkkmloxf?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>

  <p>Let's focus on the line above by starting with two points on it: \((2,1)\) and \((8,3)\).</p>

  <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ecca7xg5ag?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>

  <p>As a point moves at a constant speed along the straight line from \((x_0,y_0)=(2,1)\) to \((x_1,y_1)=(8,3)\), geometry tells us that it also moves at the same rate and proportion as the \(x\)-coordinates move from \(2\) to \(8\) and as the \(y\)-coordinates move from \(1\) to \(3\). If we say that the point \((2,1)\) is at \(t=0\) and the point \((8,3)\) is at the time \(t=1\), then the midpoint will be at time \(t=1/2\). We will be one-third of the way at \(t=1/3\), and so on.</p>

  <p>We will denote the change in \(x\) from \(x_0=2\) to \(x_1=8\) by \(\Delta x\) and the change in \(y\) from \(y_0=1\) to \(y_1=3\) as \(\Delta y.\)</p>

  <p>The expression \(x=2+6t\) gives us our \(x\)-coordinates at any time \(t\). There is an \(x\)-distance of \(6\) from \(x=2\) to \(x=8\). We see in this formula that \(x=2\) at \(t=0\) and \(x=8\) at \(t=1\). We get a similar thing for \(y\): \(y=1+2t\). Thus our parametric equation(s) for the line that contains \((2,1)\) and \((8,3)\) is \((x,y)=(2+6t,1+2t)\). </p>
    
  <p>Notice that we choose \(t\) so that at \(t=0\), we get the point \((x_0,y_0)\) and at \(t=1\), we get the point \((x_1,y_1)\). Moreover, we can think of \(t\) as the fraction of the way from point \(A\) to point \(B\). When \(t=0.5\), we get the midpoint; when \(t=1/3\), we get the point one-third of the way from \(A\) to \(B\), and so on. The nice thing about this is that all the points where \(t&gt;1\) are the points past \(B\) on this line, and the points where \(t&lt;0\) are the points "before" \(A\) on this line. In other words, \(t\) coordinatizes this line in such a way that \(A\) is the zero point, \(B\) is the point corresponding to one, and all the rest line up in order as we would want! Thus our line, represented in parametric form with the parameter \(t\), is \((x,y)=(x_0+\Delta x\cdot t,y_0+\Delta y\cdot t)\).</p>

      <h4>(Basic) Parametric Equations for a Line</h4>
    </header>
    <div class="w3-container"><p>Suppose \(A(x_0,y_0)\) and \(B(x_1,y_1)\) are two points on a line. The <em>run</em> \(\Delta x\) from \(A\) to \(B\) is \(x_1-x_0\) and the <em>rise</em> \(\Delta y\) from \(A\) to \(B\) is \(y_1-y_0.\)</p>
    <p>We can express the line using the parameter \(t\) as follows:\[(x,y)=(x_0+\Delta x\cdot t,y_0+\Delta y\cdot t),\] where \(A\) is the point on the graph when \(t=0\) and \(B\) is the point on the graph when \(t=1\).
    </p>
    <p>We can also write this using the pair of equations 
      \[\begin{cases} x=x_0+\Delta x\cdot t \\ y=y_0+\Delta y\cdot t \end{cases}.\]</p>
    <p>We can also emphasize the role of \(t\) in \(x\) and \(y\) by writing the equations as follows:
      \[\begin{cases} x_t=x_0+\Delta x\cdot t \\ y_t=y_0+\Delta y\cdot t \end{cases}.\]</p></div>
  </div>

  <p>We reexpress this idea in a slightly more geometric manner to create what is often referred to as the <em>Point of Division Formula</em>.</p>
