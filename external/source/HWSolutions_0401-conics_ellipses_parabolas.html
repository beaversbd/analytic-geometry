      <ol type="1">
        <li>Graph the following ellipses. Identify all six pieces of key information for each.
          <ol type="a">
            <li><p>\(\frac{x^2}{9}+\frac{y^2}{16}=1\)</p>
                <p>This equation has the standard form for an ellipse. Since the larger denominator is that of the \(y\)-term, this is an ellipse whose major axis is vertical. We see that \(a=4\) and \(b=3,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{4^2-3^2}=\sqrt{7}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>

            <li><p>\(\frac{x^2}{16}+\frac{y^2}{9}=1\)</p>
              <p>This equation has the standard form for an ellipse. Since the larger denominator is that of the \(x\)-term, this is an ellipse whose major axis is horizontal. We see that \(a=4\) and \(b=3,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{4^2-3^2}=\sqrt{7}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
              <p><img src="img/HW20240401_01b.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
            <li><p>\(\frac{x^2}{5}+\frac{y^2}{7}=1\)</p>
              <p>This equation has the standard form for an ellipse. Since the larger denominator is that of the \(y\)-term, this is an ellipse whose major axis is vertical. We see that \(a=\sqrt{7}\) and \(b=\sqrt{5},\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{7-5}=\sqrt{2}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
              <p><img src="img/HW20240401_01c.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
            <li><p>\(9x^2+16y^2-144=0\)</p>
              <p>This equation is not in standard form. We can put it in standard form as follows: \(9x^2+16y^2-144=0\Rightarrow 9x^2+16y^2=144\Rightarrow \frac{9x^2}{144}+\frac{16y^2}{144}=1\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{16}+\frac{y^2}{9}=1.\) This is the same equation as problem 1b. The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
              <p><img src="img/HW20240401_01b.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
            <li><p>\(25x^2+9y^2-225=0\)</p>
              <p>This equation is not in standard form. We can put it in standard form as follows: \(25x^2+9y^2-225=0\Rightarrow 25x^2+9y^2=225\Rightarrow \frac{25x^2}{225}+\frac{9y^2}{225}=1\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{9}+\frac{y^2}{25}=1.\)  Since the larger denominator is that of the \(y\)-term, this is an ellipse whose major axis is vertical. We see that \(a=4\) and \(b=3,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{4^2-3^2}=\sqrt{7}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
              <p><img src="img/HW20240401_01e.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
            <li><p>\(x^2+4y^2-4=0\)</p>
              <p>This equation is not in standard form. We can put it in standard form as follows: \(x^2+4y^2-4=0\Rightarrow x^2+4y^2=4\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{4y^2}{4}=1\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{1}=1.\) Since the larger denominator is that of the \(x\)-term, this is an ellipse whose major axis is horizontal. We see that \(a=2\) and \(b=1,\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{2^2-1^2}=\sqrt{3}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
              <p><img src="img/HW20240401_01f.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
            <li><p>\(\frac{x^2}{3}+2y^2-6=0\)</p>
              <p>This equation is not in standard form. We can put it in standard form as follows: \(\frac{x^2}{3}+2y^2-6=0\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{3}+2y^2=6\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{18}+\frac{2y^2}{6}=1\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{18}+\frac{y^2}{3}=1.\) Since the larger denominator is that of the \(x\)-term, this is an ellipse whose major axis is horizontal. We see that \(a=\sqrt{18}\) and \(b=\sqrt{3},\) and we can calculate that \(c=\sqrt{18-3}=\sqrt{15}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>

           <li><p>\(x^2=4y\)</p>
            <p>This equation has the standard form for a parabola that opens upward. In this equation, \(4c=4,\) and so \(c=1.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
            <p><img src="img/HW20240401_02a.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>

            <p>This equation has the standard form for a parabola that opens upward. In this equation, \(4c=8,\) and so \(c=2.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>

           <li><p>\(x^2=3y\)</p>
            <p>This equation has the standard form for a parabola that opens upward. In this equation, \(4c=3,\) and so \(c=\frac{3}{4}.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
            <p><img src="img/HW20240401_02c.png" class="w3-image" /></p></li>
           <li><p>\(x^2=-12y\)</p>
            <p>This equation has the standard form for a parabola that opens downward. In this equation, \(4c=12,\) and so \(c=3.\) The key information is labeled on the following graph:</p>
