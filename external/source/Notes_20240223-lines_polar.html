<title>Lines: Polar Equations</title>
</head>

<body>
    
<div class="w3-container">

  <p>Equations for lines using polar coordinates are not as nice as equations in rectangular coordinates. However, if we are working in polar coordinates, we still need a way to express lines.</p>

  <p>The easiest way to express lines in polar coordinates is the special case of lines through the pole. All the points on a line through the pole can be expressed with the same \(\theta\)-coordinate \(\theta_1.\) Thus the equation for such a line can be expressed as \(\theta=\theta_1.\) For example, all the points on with a \(\theta\)-coordinate of \(30^\circ\) can be expressed as the equation \(\theta=30^\circ.\)</p>

  <p>Vertical lines have the form \(x=a\) in rectangular coordinates. The easiest way to get an equation for a vertical line using polar coordinates is to use our conversion equation \(x=r\cos\theta\). Substituting this into \(x=a\), we get \(r\cos\theta = a.\) We can manipulate this to \(r=\frac{a}{\cos\theta}\) or to \(r=a\sec\theta\) if we would prefer the equation expressed as a function of \(\theta.\)</p>

  <p>Horizontal lines have the form \(y=b\) in rectangular coordinates. The easiest way to get an equation for a horizontal line using polar coordinates is to use our conversion equation \(y=r\sin\theta\). Substituting this into \(y=b\), we get \(r\sin\theta = b.\) We can manipulate this to \(r=\frac{b}{\sin\theta}\) or to \(r=a\csc\theta\) if we would prefer the equation expressed as a function of \(\theta.\)</p>

  <p>Finally, if we exclude lines through the pole/origin, vertical lines, and horizontal lines, we are left with oblique lines that do not go through the origin. These can be expressed in slope-intercept form as \(y=mx+b\), where \(b\) is not zero. Using our conversion equations, we get \(r\sin\theta=m(r\cos\theta)+b.\) Solving for \(r\), we get \(r=\frac{b}{\sin\theta-m\cos\theta}.\)</p>

  <p>Alternatively, we could start with general form \(Ax+By+C=0\) and have a single form for oblique, vertical, and horizontal lines that don't go through the pole (\(C\neq 0\)). Substituting, we get \(A(r\cos\theta)+B(r\sin\theta)+C=0.\). Solving for \(r\), we get \(r=\frac{-C}{A\cos\theta+B\sin\theta}.\) Notice that this form can also work with vertical or horizontal lines so long as they don't go through the origin/pole.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the best way to give a general line not through the pole is to use intercept form: \(\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1\). Substitute to get \(\frac{r\cos\theta}{a}+\frac{r\sin\theta}{b}=1.\) Multiply both sides by \(ab\) to eliminate fractions: \(rb\cos\theta+ra\sin\theta=ab.\) Factor out \(r\) and then divide to solve for \(r\): \(r=\frac{ab}{b\cos\theta+a\sin\theta}.\)</p>

  <p>You can experiment with this formula in the following desmos graph (click on <em>edit graph on desmos</em> to open in a new tab). Try changing the \(x\)-intercept using the slider for \(a\) and the \(y\)-intercept using the slider for \(b.\)</p>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>lines through the pole: a line through the pole contains all the points who have a given angle \(\theta_0\) for their \(\theta\)-coordinate. These lines have an equation of the form \(\theta=\theta_0\).</li>
      <li>lines not through the pole: if a line does not go through the pole, it is easiest to describe it in rectangular coordinates and then convert it to polar. There are three main types:
        <ul>
          <li>vertical lines \(r=a\sec\theta\): use the vertical line equation \(x=a\) and  \(x=r\cos\theta\) to get \(r=a\sec\theta\).</li>
          <li>horizontal lines \(r=b\csc\theta\): use the horizontal line equation \(y=b\) and \(y=r\sin\theta\) to get \(r=b\csc\theta\).</li>
          <li>oblique lines \(r=\frac{ab}{b\cos\theta+a\sin\theta}\) (or use a standard form such as \(\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1,\) \(y=mx+b,\) or \(Ax+By=C\) and convert using \(x=r\cos\theta\) and \(y=r\sin\theta\)).</li>
