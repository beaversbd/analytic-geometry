      <ol type="1">
        <li>Determine whether the lines are parallel or not.
          <ol type="a">
            <li><p>\(y=2x+3\) and \(y=3x+2\)</p>
                <p>These are distinct oblique lines with slope \(2\) and \(3.\) Since these slopes are not the same, these lines are not parallel.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(y=2x+4\) and \(y=2x+5\)</p>
                <p>These are distinct oblique lines with the same slope: \(2.\) Since the slopes are the same, these lines are parallel.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(3x+2y=6\) and \(2x-3y=4\)</p>
                <p>We must find the slopes of these two oblique lines. Solving the first equation for \(y\) yields \(y=-\frac{3}{2}x+2\) with a slope of \(-3/2\). Solving the second equation for \(y\) yields \(y=\frac{2}{3}x-\frac{4}{3}\) with a slope of \(2/3\). Since the slops are the not the same, these lines are not parallel.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(x=2\) and \(y=3\)</p>
                <p>These are not parallel because one is vertical line and the other is a horizontal line; they intersect in the point \((2,3).\)</p></li>
            <li><p>\(0x+3y=6\) and \(0x+y=2\)</p>
                <p>These are the same horizontal line \(y=2.\) Thus they are not parallel.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(y-1=2(x+3)\) and \(y-1=-\frac{1}{2}(x+3)\)</p>
                <p>These are distinct oblique lines with slope \(2\) and \(1/2.\) Since the slopes are not the same, the lines are not parallel.</p></li>
            <li><p>\(2x+4y=8\) and \(y=-\frac{1}{2}x+2\)</p>
                <p>If we solve the first equation for \(y\), we get \(y=\frac{1}{2}x+2\), which is the same as the second equation. Thus these are not parallel.</p></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><p><em>Give an equation for the line through \((1,2)\) that is parallel to \(y=3x+5.\)</em></p>
            <p>This line must contain the point \((1,2)\) and have the same slope, \(3\), as the line \(y=3x+5.\) Thus an equation for this line is \(y-2=3(x-1).\)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>If the line through \((a,5)\) and \((4,3)\) is parallel to a line with slope 3, find the value of \(a.\)</em></p>
            <p>The slope through these two points must be same as the line it is parallel to, namely \(3.\) Thus \(\frac{5-3}{a-4}=3.\) Hence \(3(a-4)=2.\) Therefore \(a=14/3.\)</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Use slopes to show that \((1,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((3,-2)\), and \((0,-2)\) are the vertices of a parallelogram.</em></p>
            <p>The top and bottom sides are both horizontal, and so, they are parallel. The left and right sides both have slope \(3\), and so, they are parallel.</p>
            <p><img src="img/HW20240228_01.png" class="w3-image" /></p>
            <p>Since opposite sides of this quadrilateral are parallel, the four vertices must be that of a parallelogram. </p></li>
